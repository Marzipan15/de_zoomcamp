###Question 3
SELECT COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM green_tripdata_2019
WHERE
    lpep_pickup_datetime < '2019-11-01'
    AND lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
    AND trip_distance <= 1


###Question 4
SELECT
    CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE) AS pickup_day,
    MAX(trip_distance) AS max_distance
FROM green_tripdata_2019
GROUP BY CAST(lpep_pickup_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY max_distance DESC
LIMIT 1


###Question 5
SELECT
    t2.zone AS dropoff_zone,
    MAX(t1.tip_amount) AS max_tip
FROM green_tripdata_2019 AS t1
INNER JOIN taxi_zone_lookup AS t2 ON t1.dolocationid = t2.locationid
WHERE
    t1.lpep_pickup_datetime <= '2019-10-31'
    AND t1.lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
    AND t1.pulocationid
    = (SELECT LocationID FROM taxi_zone_lookup WHERE Zone = 'East Harlem North')
GROUP BY t2.zone
ORDER BY max_tip DESC
LIMIT 1


### Question 6
SELECT
    t2.zone AS dropoff_zone,
    MAX(t1.tip_amount) AS max_tip
FROM green_tripdata_2019 AS t1
INNER JOIN taxi_zone_lookup AS t2 ON t1.dolocationid = t2.locationid
WHERE
    t1.lpep_pickup_datetime <= '2019-10-31'
    AND t1.lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-10-01'
    AND t1.pulocationid
    = (SELECT LocationID FROM taxi_zone_lookup WHERE Zone = 'East Harlem North')
GROUP BY t2.zone
ORDER BY max_tip DESC
LIMIT 1
